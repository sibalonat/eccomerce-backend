This app has been build while trying to use more express, jwt, and mongodb for the DB.
The The back-end uses technologies and modules such as: 

- "bcryptjs" -> hashing the password
- "cors" -> same route or different route, same response 
- "dotenv" -> support for env files where you could store configuration files
- "express" -> router, server, and methods
- "jsonwebtoken" -> authentication
- "mongoose" -> connection to mongodb
- "morgan"
- "nodemon" -> server
